# About Respiro

Respiro is an AI-first software company. We design and build SaaS products where intelligent automation and copilots are not add‑ons, but the foundation. Our mission is to give every team superpowers—shortening feedback loops, removing toil, and unlocking better decisions with trustworthy data.

What AI-first means to us
- Design around agents and copilots from day one
- Human-in-the-loop by default with clear controls and auditability
- Privacy-first data pipelines with purpose-bound access and retention
- Practical outcomes: faster cycle times, higher quality, better customer experience

What we build
- Workflow copilots that live where your teams already work (CRM, support, marketing, operations)
- Secure data layers that connect product, marketing, and revenue systems
- Evaluations and analytics that measure impact, not just activity

How we work
- Ship fast, learn faster. Small, senior teams owning outcomes end-to-end.
- Open by default. Wherever possible, we use open standards and contribute back.
- Security and compliance from day one. Data governance is a product feature, not an afterthought.

Why Respiro
- AI-native architecture that scales with you
- Clear ROI: time saved, revenue gained, risk reduced
- A partner mindset—we build with you, not just for you

Leadership and team
We are headquartered in Oslo, Norway with a distributed team across Europe. We’ve led engineering and product at startups and enterprises, and we’re experienced in deploying AI safely at scale.
